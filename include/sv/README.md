# sv

Simple [String_View](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view) implementation for C programming language.

## Quick Start

Just copy [sv.h](./sv.h) into your project and include it like this:

```c
#define SV_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "./sv.h"
```

Keep in mind that sv is an [stb-style header-only library](https://github.com/nothings/stb). For more information on that `SV_IMPLEMENTATION` thingie see [stb_howto.txt](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/stb_howto.txt)

For examples on how to use the library functions check [./test.c](./test.c).
